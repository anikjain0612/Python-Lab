To investigate different operators and expressions

To grasp fundamental input and output processes
​

Theory

1. Python Setup and User Interface

The Python setup offers utilities and interfaces for coding, running, and troubleshooting Python scripts. Python code can run through various interfaces like:

Python command line

Jupyter Notebook

Development tools (IDEs) such as Spyder, PyCharm, or VS Code

Online platforms like Google Colab

This setup enables coding, running commands, and seeing results in real time.
​

2. Python Execution Methods

Python offers two primary ways to run code:


a) Interactive Method

Runs commands line by line

Shows results instantly

Ideal for quick tests and learning basics

Examples include Python shell, Jupyter cells, and Google Colab.
​

b) Script Method

Saves code in a file and runs everything together

Best for full programs

Files end with .py
​

3. Comments in Python

Comments add explanations to code without running them, aiding clarity.

Single-line comments: Start with #

Multi-line comments: Use triple quotes (""" """)

They support documentation and code comprehension.
​

4. Variables and Naming Rules

Variables hold data in named memory spots.

Naming Rules:

Begin with letter (A-Z, a-z) or _

No starting digit

Case matters

Avoid Python reserved words

Python features dynamic typing—no need to declare types ahead.
​

5. Data Types in Python

Python has core data types for various data.

Core Data Types

Integer (int): Full numbers

Float: Numbers with decimals

String (str): Text sequences

Boolean (bool): True/False values

Use type() to check a variable's type.
​

6. Operators and Expressions

Operators apply actions to data and values.

Operator Categories

Math Operators: For calculations (+, -, *, /, %)

Comparison Operators: For checks (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)

Logic Operators: To link conditions (and, or, not)

Assignment Operators: For value setting (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)

Bit Operators: Bit-level actions (&, |, ^, <<, >>)

Expressions mix operators and data to yield results.
​

7. Simple Input and Output

These let programs interact with users.

Input:
input() takes user data as string; convert types if needed.

Output:
print() shows results; format with commas or strings.
