## Title : Study of loops in python

## Introduction


Loops are an essential concept in Python programming used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Instead of writing the same instructions multiple times, loops automate repetition and make programs efficient and readable.

This project demonstrates the practical use of while loops and for loops through multiple programs such as mathematical calculations, number operations, searching, matrix operations, and pattern printing.

## Python mainly provides:

while loop

for loop

along with control statements like:

break

continue

if conditions

nested loops

## Study of Loops 

Understand iteration using while and for loops

Learn input-based looping

Practice mathematical programs using loops

Study loop control statements (break & continue)

Learn nested loops using patterns and matrices

Observe logic building using real examples

Practice pattern printing and number problems



### Key Concepts Covered

while loop

for loop

break statement

continue statement

conditional statements

nested loops

list traversal

matrix operations

pattern generation

number-based algorithms

## Theory (Loops in Python)
 While Loop

A while loop executes as long as a condition remains true.
Used when the number of iterations is unknown.


Programs Implemented

Print numbers (1–5)

User-defined iterations

Factorial calculation

Fibonacci series

Reverse a number

Count digits

Searching elements

 For Loop

A for loop iterates over sequences such as ranges, lists, or strings.

Syntax
 
for variable in range():
    statements


Programs Implemented

Print numbers

Even numbers

Sum of first n numbers

Prime number check

Armstrong number

Pattern printing

 Break Statement

Stops loop execution immediately.

Example 

Exit loop when value becomes 3.

Stop searching when element is found.

 Continue Statement

Skips current iteration and moves to the next.

Example 

Skip number 5.

Print only odd numbers.

 Nested Loops

A loop inside another loop.

#### Applications in Project

Matrix display

Matrix multiplication

Digit combinations

Pattern printing

 Algorithms (Examples)


 Algorithm: Factorial Using While Loop

Start

Input number n

Initialize fact = 1 and i = 1

Repeat while i ≤ n

Multiply fact by i

Increment i

Print factorial

Stop

 Algorithm: Fibonacci Series

Input number of terms

Initialize first two numbers

Repeat loop n times

Print current number

Update next term

Stop

 Algorithm: Search Element in List

Take list and input value

Start loop from index 0

Compare each element

If found → print position and break

If loop ends → print not found

##  Conclusion

Loops form the backbone of programming logic in Python. Through various examples such as factorials, Fibonacci series, matrix multiplication, and pattern printing, this project demonstrates how loops simplify repetitive tasks and improve coding efficiency. Mastering loops is essential for developing strong programming skills.
