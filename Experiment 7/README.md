# **Experiment 7: Study of Loops in Python**

## **Aim**

To study and implement looping statements in Python and understand repetition of statements using different loop constructs.

## **Objectives**

* To understand the concept of loops
* To implement `for` and `while` loops
* To use nested loops
* To apply loop control statements like `break`, `continue`, and `pass`
* To solve real-life programming problems using loops

  
## **Theory on Loops**

Loops in Python are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is satisfied. They help in reducing code repetition and making programs more efficient.

Python mainly provides two types of loops:

* `for` loop
* `while` loop

The `for` loop is generally used when the number of iterations is known in advance. It works with sequences like lists, tuples, strings, and ranges.

The `while` loop is used when the number of iterations depends on a condition. It runs as long as the condition remains `True`.

Python also provides loop control statements such as:

* `break` → Terminates the loop
* `continue` → Skips the current iteration
* `pass` → Acts as a placeholder

Indentation plays an important role in defining the scope of loops.


## **Types of Loops**

* `for` loop
* `while` loop
* Nested loops
* Loop control statements


# **Loop Algorithms**

## **Algorithm 1: Print Numbers from 1 to 5 (Using for Loop)**

1. Start
2. Use `range(1, 6)` to generate numbers from 1 to 5
3. Repeat for each number in the range
4. Print the number
5. Stop

---

## **Algorithm 2: Print Elements of a List**

1. Start
2. Create a list of numbers
3. Repeat for each element in the list
4. Print the element
5. Stop

---

## **Algorithm 3: Print Numbers from 1 to 5 (Using while Loop)**

1. Start
2. Initialize variable `i = 1`
3. Check if `i <= 5`
4. If true, print `i`
5. Increment `i` by 1
6. Repeat steps 3–5 until condition becomes false
7. Stop

---

## **Algorithm 4: Print Right-Angled Triangle Pattern**

1. Start
2. Use outer loop from 1 to 5
3. For each iteration of outer loop, run inner loop
4. Print `*` equal to current row number
5. Move to next line
6. Stop

---

## **Algorithm 5: Using break Statement**

1. Start
2. Run loop from 1 to 5
3. Check if number equals 3
4. If yes, terminate the loop using `break`
5. Otherwise, print the number
6. Stop

---

## **Algorithm 6: Using continue Statement**

1. Start
2. Run loop from 1 to 5
3. Check if number equals 3
4. If yes, skip current iteration using `continue`
5. Otherwise, print the number
6. Stop


## Program 1: Simple for Loop

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```


## Program 2: for Loop with List

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]

for num in numbers:
    print(num)
```


## Program 3: while Loop

```python
i = 1

while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```


## Program 4: Nested Loop (Right-Angled Triangle)

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(i):
        print("*", end="")
    print()
```

## Program 5: Loop Control Statements

### Using break

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
```

### Using continue

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
```


## **Applications of Loops**

* Printing patterns
* Iterating through lists and strings
* Calculating sums and averages
* Checking prime numbers
* Menu-driven programs
* Repetitive real-life tasks

##  **Conclusion**

Loops form the backbone of programming logic in Python. Through various examples such as factorials, Fibonacci series, matrix multiplication, and pattern printing, this project demonstrates how loops simplify repetitive tasks and improve coding efficiency. Mastering loops is essential for developing strong programming skills.
