# Experiment 7: Study of loops in python

## Aim

To study and implement looping statements in Python and understand repetition of statements using different loop constructs.

## Objectives

* To understand the concept of loops
* To implement `for` and `while` loops
* To use nested loops
* To apply loop control statements like `break`, `continue`, and `pass`
* To solve real-life programming problems using loops
  
## Theory
 While Loop

A while loop executes as long as a condition remains true.
Used when the number of iterations is unknown.


Programs Implemented

Print numbers (1–5)

User-defined iterations

Factorial calculation

Fibonacci series

Reverse a number

Count digits

Searching elements

 For Loop

A for loop iterates over sequences such as ranges, lists, or strings.

Syntax
 
for variable in range():
    statements


Programs Implemented

Print numbers

Even numbers

Sum of first n numbers

Prime number check

Armstrong number

Pattern printing

 Break Statement

Stops loop execution immediately.

Example 

Exit loop when value becomes 3.

Stop searching when element is found.

 Continue Statement

Skips current iteration and moves to the next.

Example 

Skip number 5.

Print only odd numbers.

 Nested Loops

A loop inside another loop.

#### Applications in Project

Matrix display

Matrix multiplication

Digit combinations

Pattern printing

 Algorithms (Examples)


 Algorithm: Factorial Using While Loop

Start

Input number n

Initialize fact = 1 and i = 1

Repeat while i ≤ n

Multiply fact by i

Increment i

Print factorial

Stop

 Algorithm: Fibonacci Series

Input number of terms

Initialize first two numbers

Repeat loop n times

Print current number

Update next term

Stop

 Algorithm: Search Element in List

Take list and input value

Start loop from index 0

Compare each element

If found → print position and break

If loop ends → print not found

##  Conclusion

Loops form the backbone of programming logic in Python. Through various examples such as factorials, Fibonacci series, matrix multiplication, and pattern printing, this project demonstrates how loops simplify repetitive tasks and improve coding efficiency. Mastering loops is essential for developing strong programming skills.
